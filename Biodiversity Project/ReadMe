On codeacademy I completed the Biodiversity in National Parks analysis.
I was given 2 data sets on different information on species classed into category, park, observation, species name and conservation status.
There were no assignment details, just an opened ended project.
I had to come up with my own questions to answer, which I did by analysing the column names and brainstorming different relationships that would
be useful in biodiversity analysis such as popular categories, parks, most endangered species...

When it came to do conservation status analysis I encountered another problem where majority of the endangered species list had NaN values. I first
set them to Unknown for the basic EDA then used bootstrapping methods to create a full dataset for analysis.

This was a fun project to see what insights I could gather. I concluded by building a Random Forest Classifier model to predict conservation status,
which was 97% accurate. Any feedback on the project would be appreciated.
