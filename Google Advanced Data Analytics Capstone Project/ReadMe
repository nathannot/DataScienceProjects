Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone Project - Predicting Employee Turnover at Salifort Motors
Methodology:
Import Data: Data from Salifort Motors' employee surveys, encompassing variables like job title, department,
number of projects, and average monthly hours, was imported for analysis.

Clean Data: The dataset underwent rigorous cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data integrity for accurate analysis.

Visualize Data: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques were employed to visualize relationships and patterns.

Feature Engineering: Key features influencing turnover were identified and engineered to enhance predictive modeling capabilities.

Build Logistic Regression Model: Developed a logistic regression model to predict employee turnover probabilities based on engineered features.

Build Random Forest Regression Model: Constructed a random forest regression model to capture complex relationships and improve prediction accuracy.

Summarize Findings and Report: Findings were summarized in a comprehensive report outlining model performance, key turnover predictors, and actionable 
recommendations for Salifort Motors' retention strategies.

This project demonstrates proficiency in data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and applying both logistic regression and random 
forest models to address real-world business challenges effectively.
