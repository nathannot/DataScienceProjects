To run this code you will need to download the train and test csv from site and 
rename to train_titanic.csv, test_titanic.csv

Note: For beginners the scoreboard is very misleading, since you can look up names of
Titanic survivors people can easily 1.0 score which goes against competition. Top score is
probably around 82%, that's where the first real cluster begins.

Note I only uploaded my code for this project, so if you want to use it, it's an exercise
to understand the feature engineering I used plus model selection, training and cross-validation.
