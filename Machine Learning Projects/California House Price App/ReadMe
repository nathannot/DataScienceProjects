California Price Prediction App https://cal-price-predict-51dab0ef2deb.herokuapp.com/

This is basic script that builds an interactive app to predictive house prices in California
based on the  California Housing dataset available from Luís Torgo's (University of Porto). 
Luís Torgo obtained it from the StatLib repository (which is closed now). 

I updated prediction by factor of 2.5 to take in account inflation from 1990 to 2024.

The py file is the app script. The jupyter file contains the full data science process used to
build the app. The steps involved:
1. data wrangling (cleaning exploring data)
2. Feature engineering (building appropriate features for model)
3. Pipeline to perform all wrangling and featuring engineering in one step
4. Model building (I tested 10 models to find the best models)
5. Cross Validation 
6. Hyperparameter tuning
7. Model Selection

Then with the model selected I built the basic interactive app script.
