This is a simple comment spam detection app that classifies a message as spam or not spam.
I trained the most on 4 sets of youtube comment files achieving 95% accuracy.
I then tested it on unseen data where I had the classifications and it was 93% accurate.

It works for emails or any comment. Just copy and paste into the app and it will simply
classify. To run code as it, make sure to download the youtube-spam-collection-v1 folder with 
contents as is in the same directory as app file.

I also attached the jupyter notebook with the full code of how I built the app and the jupyter
notebook with just the code to run the app.
