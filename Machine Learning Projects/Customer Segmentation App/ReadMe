Customer Segmentation App https://customer-segmentation-ebc48b28da9c.herokuapp.com/

Basic app that uses KMeans to find optimal number of clusters based on silhouette score.
You can upload the csv into app (smaller <10000) work fast. It then will provide a table
summary of the optimal clusters and the info for each cluster. I then used PCA so you
can visualise the clusters in 2D to get an idea of the cluster groupings.
