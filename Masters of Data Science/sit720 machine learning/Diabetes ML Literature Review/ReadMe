This HD assignment fot SIT 720 Machine Learning involved performing a basic literature review of a
diabetes study found here:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240584402400567X 
The task just focused on the PIMA dataset found on Kaggle (I have attached it in this folder) and I
only had to focus on the supervised learning models.  
The literature review began by doing a thorough discussion of the initial study methods, then I had
to rebuild the SL models in the study trying to replicate the same results.  
However, there were various missing details such as standarization method, how smote was applied, the
hyperparameters of the SL models and how cross validation was conducted. 
After attempting to replicate the models I had to build my own model, using a different process to the
one in the study. 
I then had to write a report detailing my exact methods. If you read my report I have thoroughly detailed
each step so you should be able reproduce my results following the method laid out in the report.  
Lastly I presented the results in a short report.
