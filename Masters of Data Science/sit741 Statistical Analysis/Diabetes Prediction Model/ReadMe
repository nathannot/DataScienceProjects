For the first Distinction Task for Sit741 one of the tasks was to provide an example
with references from real world applications demonstrating that linear regression models
are not suitable and that Generalised Additive Models (GAM) might be a better choice.  
I decided to answer this question by conducting my own analysis on a real world dataset
to predict if a person has diabetes. 
The report summarises the results, which in essence show GAM models are more suitable than
linear models in certain circumstances.  
In the python code I also conducted extra analysis (not part of the report as it wasn't a part
of the question) comparing GAM predictive model to Random Forest Model.
Both the GAM and Random Forest model were 97% accurate, however, the GAM model performed
marignally better (you can read the python file to see which metrics I used).
