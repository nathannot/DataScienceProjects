Nous Data Analytics Virtual Experience was offered on Propsale:
https://au.prosple.com/virtual-experience/51268

It involved getting data from ABS on student teacher ratios in Australian States/Territories

Task was to find:
How has the student to teacher ratio in Queenslandâ€™s government-run high schools compared 
over time with other schools in the state and those in NSW and Victoria?

Analysis was conducted in python and findings presented in PowerPoint.
Was a simple task as the question only asked for general insights.
If I wanted to break it into further analysis I could extract data on teacher and student numbers by year
for each Affiliation category and compare. Also compare by primary vs secondary. 
This folder just contains the task that was asked by Nous in this Virtual Experience
