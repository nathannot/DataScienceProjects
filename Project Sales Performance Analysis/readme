Was tasked with the following project:
Business Requirements:
Objective: Analyze sales data to provide insights into the performance of different products, regions, and sales representatives.

Key Questions to Answer:
What are the total sales and the number of units sold for each product?
Which products are the top performers and which are underperforming?
How do sales vary across different regions?
Are there any noticeable trends or seasonality in the sales data?
Provide recommendations for improving sales based on your analysis.

To answer these questions I followed ETL pipeline practices:
1. I extracted the csv data.
2. I transformed the data to relevant format getting rid of NaNs, changing object types and creating data visuals.
3. I loaded data back into seperate csv file to answer question 1.
I included a summary report and insights on how to improve data
