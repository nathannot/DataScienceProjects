Collection of Tasks completed for Quantium Job Simulation.
Task 1: 
This repository contains the code and analysis for a category review focused on customer segments and chip purchasing behavior. The analysis includes the following steps:

Data Loading and Checks: Data files were loaded into pandas DataFrames and checked for consistency and accuracy.
Feature Engineering: Pack size and brand names were derived from product descriptions.
Metrics of Interest: Key metrics such as total spend, average spend per transaction, frequency of purchases, preferred pack size, and brand preference were defined and analyzed.
Segment Analysis: Customers were segmented based on purchasing behavior, and spend and behavior for each segment were analyzed to draw insights.
Strategic Recommendations: Based on the findings, clear and commercially viable recommendations were formulated for the Category Manager, Julia.
For detailed analysis and code, please refer to the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository.

Task 2: Selecting Control Stores for Trial Evaluation
Objective:
Identify suitable control stores that have similar performance metrics to the trial stores before the trial period started. 
These control stores will serve as a baseline to compare against the trial stores to evaluate the trialâ€™s impact on sales.

Task 3: Presentation Summarising finds from Task 1 and 2
